		<p>The Core9 Framework is not your average framework. Meaning in
			general frameworks provide some kind of functionality usually in the
			application layer.
			Core9 doesn't provide any functionality it's main
			goal is to provide good
			standards and ideas to grow code.
			So instead
			of
			focusing on code that should make your life easier Core9
			focuses
			on the
			methods and ideas that allow you to create testable,
			and low
			maintenance quality code yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason why core9 was created was the observation that most
			frameworks promise you everything you want such as code quality,
			unambiguous coding standards and testability.
			However in the hands of
			the average developer all those promises quickly
			disappear for
			whatever reason time, budget etc..
		</p>
		<p>
			Core9 was created from the idea that bad things are unavoidable
			and that
			in addressing this reality there might be a solution to
			creating
			that much desired deliverable many call "Quality Software".
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the assumptions that were made creating Core9 was that
			the
			biggest corrupter of good software is incidental complexity due
			to
			whatever reason.
			The way that Core9 tries to deal with this problem
			is
			to provide a
			method of coding that focuses the developer to note
			some
			of the main
			ideas that were produced in the short history of
			programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			So rather than being a bag of goodies Core9 tries to be a book
			of
			experiences and ideas as we recognize a developers most important
			tool is his intellectual capacity and his only true framework is
			that
			of his own mind.
		</p>
