===============

We, the creators of the Core9 Framework believe current Java frameworks have problems keeping up with the rapidly changing overall technology stack. Server virtualization, application containerization, non blocking IO and NoSQL aren't supported very well. Also, the current technologies often have problems with Continuous Delivery because of the lack of  modularization.

We wanted a framework that doesn't do much more than connecting modules together. We currently have around 40 small modules that fulfill only a specific goal. These goals range from simple database operations to fully embedded HTTP servers. The modules are coupled together only on API's, making it very easy to scale horizontally and vertically.

The Core9 Framework also seeks to leverage the new Nashorn JavaScript engine in JDK 8. We are trying to create an web environment in which server side JavaScript coding and debugging can be done easily.

Our intented users are Java and JavaScript users. Our main goal lays in web technology. But the Framework can do much more, as no assumptions on business process or end user interfacing are made. The framework can run on any operating system that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
